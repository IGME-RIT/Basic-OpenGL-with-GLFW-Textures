# Basic OpenGL with GLFW: Fragment Shaders

This program introduces basic concepts involved in writing an OpenGL program.

# About

The rasterizer allows us to map vertex data directly to coordinates in a texture.
This example builds on top of the Fragment Shaders example, and demonstrates loading a texture with a library, and all the steps required to use that texture within a shader.

# Setup

You will need to have CMake installed on your computer, and properly added to your path.
In order to setup, run the following in a shell, then open the project in your preferred editor.
Windows setup has been configured for use with Visual Studio.

Windows:
```
cd path/to/folder
setup.cmd
```
Linux:
```
cd path/to/folder
./setup
```
